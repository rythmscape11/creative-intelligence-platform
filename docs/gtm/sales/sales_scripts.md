# Sales Enablement Strategy: Scripts & Decks

## 1. Sales Scripts

### Script A: The "Compliance Headache" (Target: CTOs/CISOs)
**SDR:** "Hi [Name], I noticed you're scaling your engineering team. Usually, that means SOC 2 audits are around the corner. Are you still managing evidence in spreadsheets, or have you automated it?"
**Prospect:** "Spreadsheets, unfortunately."
**SDR:** "I hear that a lot. We built Antigravity to automate that evidence collection directly from your infrastructure code. It typically saves engineering teams about 20 hours a month. Would it be worth 15 minutes to see how we map Terraform to SOC 2 controls?"

### Script B: The "Frugal Innovation" (Target: Founders/CFOs)
**SDR:** "Hi [Name], saw your recent funding news—congrats! I'm reaching out because we help startups extend their runway by capping cloud costs at the infrastructure level."
**Prospect:** "We have a handle on costs."
**SDR:** "That's great. Most founders do until they hit scale. We implement a 'hard stop' governor that prevents any API bill from exceeding a set limit, guaranteed. It's like insurance for your burn rate. Open to a quick demo?"

### Script C: Objection Handling - "No Hurry"
**Prospect:** "We're interested, but this isn't a priority right now. Call us next quarter."
**Rep:** "I completely understand. Just so I can prioritize my follow-up—is the delay because of budget, or are you waiting for a specific compliance trigger like a new enterprise deal?"
**Prospect:** "We're waiting for a big deal to close."
**Rep:** "Makes sense. Often, those big deals require the SOC 2 report *before* they sign. If we start the automated collection now, you'll have the evidence ready instantly when they ask, speeding up your deal cycle by weeks. Shall we just set up the passive collector today?"
